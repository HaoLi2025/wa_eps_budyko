## A gridded annual runoff dataset from 1982 to 2016 for Peru

A gridded annual runoff dataset from 1982 to 2016 has been developed using [PISCO dataset](http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.SENAMHI/.HSR/.PISCO/): streamflow, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration (from temperature using Hargreaves-Samani). A probabilistic Budyko approach was used to estimate runoff using 14 spatial clusters where an empirical distribution of omega (Fu's parameter) was fitted to the data. In this sense, a maximum, mean, and minimum value is given for runoff in each grid.
